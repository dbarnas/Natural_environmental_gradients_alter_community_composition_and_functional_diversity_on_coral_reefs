Abstract:
Environmental variability caused by natural gradients in marine ecosystems promotes shifts in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Coral reefs experience a multitude of natural and anthropogenic environmental gradients affecting presence and abundance of both community species and functional traits. Shifts in functional diversity can lead to changes in community metabolism (net ecosystem production and calcification [NEP and NEC]) as the altered community interacts with its environment. In this study, we tested the impact of a common but under-investigated natural environmental gradient on coral reefs, submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). SGD is the expulsion of terrestrial fresh or recirculated seawater onto a marine environment and is associated with decreasing temperatures, salinity, and pH with increasing nutrients and variable carbonate chemistry. We quantified changes in species and functional diversity and broad community composition along an SGD gradient in Mo'orea, French Polynesia to understand how this suite of biogeochemical variables impacts reef communities. Richness of species and functional entities along the SGD gradient displayed a polynomial relationship to SGD parameters, with peak richness at moderate SGD. Functional community composition (presence and abundance) increased along the variability gradient, while
species composition was insignificant, highlighting the utility of testing multiple biodiversity metrics on community response to environmental shifts. These studies showed the impacts of SGD through shifts in diversity and community composition in a highly variable biogeochemical environment. SGD is present across multiple ecosystems globally and provides a unique opportunity to study community responses across a variety of ecosystems. As global ecosystems are increasingly impacted by environmental variability and new disturbance pressures, we can look at community responses to multivariable environmental shifts already occurring naturally within SGD gradients to understand how additional variability may alter ecosystem stability.
